# Automated Bank Account Statement Organizer

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an automated system that efficiently organizes bank account statements from multiple banks in Microsoft Excel. The automation process should extract relevant data from statements provided in CSV, PDF, and XML formats and organize it in a structured format within Excel files. The project aims to improve the efficiency of managing financial records.

## Requirements

### Data Source
- The system should support the import of bank account statements in CSV, PDF, and XML formats.
- Users should be able to specify the location of the source files.

### Data Extraction
- The system should extract the following information from each bank statement, regardless of the format:
  - Transaction Date
  - Description/Transaction Name
  - Amount
  - Transaction Type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal)
  - Account Balance (if available)
- The system should be capable of handling statements in CSV, PDF, and XML formats with varying structures.

### Excel Integration
- The extracted data should be organized into Excel spreadsheets.
- Users should be able to specify the destination folder for the Excel files.
- Each Excel file should represent a specific time period (e.g., a month) and contain a summary of transactions.

### Categorization
- The system should provide an option for users to categorize transactions.
- Users should be able to define custom categories for transactions.
- Transactions should be automatically categorized based on predefined rules if available.

### Bank Statement Template Flexibility
- The system should be designed to accommodate bank statement templates from multiple banks, and it should be easy to add support for new bank statement formats without significant code changes.
- A template or configuration mechanism should be provided to define the structure and data extraction rules for each new bank's statement format.
- Users should have the ability to add new bank statement templates or configure existing ones easily through a user-friendly interface or configuration file.

### Automation Triggers
- Users should have the option to initiate the automation process manually.
- The system should support scheduled automation at specified intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly).

### Error Handling
- The system should log and notify users of any errors encountered during the automation process.
- Users should have the option to review and address errors manually.

### User Interface
- The project should include a user-friendly interface for configuring settings and initiating the automation process.
- The interface should provide feedback on the status of the automation.

### Backup and Security
- The system should have mechanisms for data backup and ensure the security of financial data.
- Password protection and encryption should be considered for sensitive data.

### Testing
- Comprehensive testing should be performed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the automation process.
- Test cases should cover various bank statement formats (CSV, PDF, XML) and scenarios.

### Documentation
- The project should include documentation that outlines how to set up, configure, and use the automation system.
- Troubleshooting guidance should be provided.

### Compatibility
- The system should be compatible with [list compatible operating systems and Excel versions].

### Scalability
- The system should be designed to handle a growing volume of bank statements in CSV, PDF, and XML formats efficiently.

### Performance
- The automation process should be optimized for speed and resource efficiency.

### Maintenance
- Consideration should be given to ongoing maintenance, updates, and improvements to the system.

### Legal and Compliance
- Ensure compliance with relevant financial and data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, if applicable).

### Constraints
- The project should be completed within a specified timeline and budget.

### Assumptions
- Users are responsible for obtaining and providing their own bank account statements in CSV, PDF, or XML formats.

### Dependencies
- List any external dependencies or third-party tools/libraries required for the project.
